## Main Dependencies
### [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)
The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

### [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit)
A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java

### [Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin)
Koin is a pragmatic lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers to whom we will give the responsibility to instantiate the different objects of our application.

### [MockK](https://github.com/mockk/mockk)
Most JVM mock libraries have problems with mocking or stubbing final classes. Of course, we can add the “open” keyword to classes and methods that we want to mock. But changing classes only for mocking some code doesn't feel like the best approach.

Here comes the MockK library, which offers support for Kotlin language features and constructs. MockK builds proxies for mocked classes. This causes some performance degradation, but the overall benefits that MockK gives us are worth it.

### [WaveLoadingView](https://github.com/tangqi92/WaveLoadingView)
An Android library that provides a realistic wave-loading effect.

### [Croller](https://github.com/harjot-oberai/Croller)
Custom seekbar
